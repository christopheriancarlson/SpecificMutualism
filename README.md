# SpecificMutualism
A place to share code for the specificity and generalism in mutualisms project. Brief description of included scripts beolw: 
### Cooperative Stability Analysis
Code for linear stability analysis, and center manifold theory stability analysis: cooperatively specialized hosts. 
### Antagonistic Stability Analysis
Code for linear stability analysis, and theory of bifurcation without parameters analysis: antagonistically specialized hosts. 
### Antagonistic Invasion Analysis
Code simulating the success of mutant invaders in a cycling population for adaptive dynamics: antagonistically specialized hosts. 
### Antagonistic Parameter Evolution 
Code simulating the success of mutant invaders of either host or symbiont type in a cycling population for adaptive dynamics: antagonistically specialized hosts. This code generates figures 5 and SI-4. 
### Cooperative Spatial Simulations
Code simulating the diffusion of hosts and symbionts across space as a system of Partial Differential Equations: cooperatively specialized hosts. Requires: [Reaction Diffusion Lab](https://library.wolfram.com/infocenter/MathSource/4433/)
### Cooperative Spatial Simulations Generalist
Using Partial Differential Equations for cooperatively specialized hosts we evaluate the success of generalist hosts when generalist payoff exceeds specialist average payoff and the diffusion rate of hosts and symbionts varies. 
### Antagonistic Spatial Simulations
Code simulating the diffusion of hosts and symbionts across space as a system of Partial Differential Equations: antagonistically specialized hosts. Requires: [Reaction Diffusion Lab](https://library.wolfram.com/infocenter/MathSource/4433/)
### Cycle Simulations Fitness Feedback
Code simulating qualitative behaviour of antagonistic specialization when fitness feedbacks determine host and symbiont fitness
